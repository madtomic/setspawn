1. BUILDING:
  i) Download a suitable Bukkit API jar from http://bukkit.org.
  ii) Issue "BUKKIT_JAR=/path/to/bukkit.jar make jar"; cross fingers.
  iii) If all went well, you're done. There should be a setspawn-x.y.jar in
       your current directory.

2. INSTALLING:
  Simply copy the jar built in the previous section to the "plugins"
  directory under your CraftBukkit server root. The plugin will automatically
  load.

3. USAGE:
  To change the spawn point, issue the command "/setspawn" (as op).
  This will update the spawn point to your current location. Note that
  doing this in the Nether or Aether is not advisable, as spawn points
  are set in terms of block coordinates. Consider yourself warned!
